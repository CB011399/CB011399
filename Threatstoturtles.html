        <h2>Threats to Turtles</h2>
        <p>
          Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean
          waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the
          colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the
          Eastern Pacific. While these highly migratory species periodically
          come ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of
          their lives in the ocean. Over the last 200 years, human activities
          have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners.
          Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer
          from poaching and over-exploitation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as
          bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle
          nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex
          of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as
          endangered, with three of theseven existing species being critically
          endangered. Sea turtles continue to be harvested unsustainably both
          for human consumption and trade of their parts. Turtle meat and eggs
          are a source of food and income for many people around the world. Some
          also kill turtles for medicine and religious ceremonies. Tens of
          thousands of sea turtles are lost this way every year, devastating
          populations of already endangered greens and hawksbills. Killing of
          turtles for both domestic and international markets continues as well.
          International trade in all sea turtle species and their parts is
          prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
          Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global agreement among
          governments to regulate or ban international trade in species under
          threat. Still, illegal trafficking persists.

        <h3>Bycatch</h3>
        <p>
          Fishermen sometimes catch and discard animals they do not want, cannot
          sell, or are not allowed to keep. This is collectively known as
          “bycatch.” Bycatch can be fish, but also includes other animals such
          as dolphins, whales, sea turtles, and seabirds that become hooked or
          entangled in fishing gear. Bycatch can negatively affect species such
          as dolphins, sea turtles, protected fish, and whales by harming
          animals, contributing to population declines, and impeding population
          recovery. Other impacts of fisheries on marine mammals may include
          removal of their preferred prey and sometimes habitat damage.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Bycatch refers to “discarded catch of marine species and unobserved
          mortality due to a direct encounter with fishing vessels and gear.”
          These unintentionally caught animals often suffer injuries or die.
          Unwanted catch is an issue both ecologically and economically. Animals
          that are discarded often die and cannot reproduce, impacting marine
          ecosystems. Bycatch can slow the rebuilding of overfished stocks, and
          place protected species such as whales and sea turtles at further
          risk. Bycatch of species like corals and sponges can cause damage to
          protected corals and to important fish habitat.

        <h3>Conservation and Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          Developing and implementing turtle-friendly gear such as using Turtle
          Excluder Devices(TEDs) in trawl nets or circle hooks in longline
          fisheries,can reduce turtle bycatch.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Governments and fisheries management organizations can establish
          regulations and standards to minimize bycatch.Strict enforcement of
          these regulations is essential to ensure compliance.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Rising awareness among fishermen about the importance of sea turtle
          conservation and providing them with training on bycatch mitigation
          techniques can help reduce unintentional captures.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Continued research and development of innovative fishing technologies
          can lead to more effective and selective gear that minimizes bycatch
          without compromising catch effectively.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Cooprention among countries and international organizations is crucial
          for addressing the issue of sea turtle bycatch,as sea turtles migrate
          across multiple jurisdictions.Sharing best practices and knowledge can
          facilitate the adoption of effective conservation measures.

        <h3>Vessel Strikes</h3>

        <p>
          Vessel strikes are a significant threat to turtle populations around
          the world.These accidents occur when boats and other watercraft
          collide with turtles,causing serious injuries or death.Turtles are
          particularly vulnerable to vessel strikes,because they are slow moving
          and often surface to breathe,making them difficult to spot from
          distance.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Vessel strikes can have devastating consequences for turtle
          populations which are already under threat from habitat loss,pollution
          and other human activities.When turtles are killed or injured by boats
          it can distrupt the natural balance of marine ecosystems and reduce
          the overall healthof these fragile environments.To protect the turtle
          populations and their habitats,it is essential to take steps to
          prevent vessel strikes and support conservation efforts that promote
          responsibility boating practices and habitat protection.

        <h3>Conservation and Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          To prevent vessel strikes,it's important to operate watercraft at safe
          speeds,be vigilant for wildlife and avoid areas where turtles are
          known to frequent.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Conservation efforts can also help protect turtle populations and
          their habitats.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Supporting organizations that work to protect turtle populations and
          their habitats is an important part of conservation.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Participating in beach clean-ups can help remove debris that can harm
          turtles and other wildlife.

        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Educating others about the importance of protecting turtle populations
          and their habitats can also help to prevent vessel strikes.

        <h3>Light and Noise Pollution</h3>
        <p>
          Light and noise pollution are significant threats to sea turtles,which
          are highly sensitive to changes in their environment.Light pollution
          can disorient hatchlings as they emerge from their nests,causing them
          to become confused and headin the wrong direction.This can make it
          difficult for them to reach the ocean and can increase their risk of
          prediction.Light pollution can also disrupt the nesting behavior of
          adult turtles,causing them to abandon their nests or lay their eggs in
          unsuitable locations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Noise pollution can also have a significant impact on sea turtles
          which rely on sound to communicate,navigate and locate prey.KLoud
          noises from boats,construction sites and other human activities can
          disrupt these vital processes and cause stress and disorientation.This
          can make it difficult for turtles to find food,mate and navigate to
          their nesting sites.To protect sea turtles from the effects of light
          and noise pollution,it is essential to take steps to reduce these
          impacts and create more turtle-friendly environments.

        <h3>Conservation and Prevention</h3>
        <p>
          To prevent light pollution,use turtle-friendly lighting that is low in
          intensity,long-wavelength and shielded to minimize glare.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          To prevent noise pollution,avoid operating boats and other watercraft
          near turtle habitats and nesting sites.

        <p>
          Support conservation efforts that work to protect turtle populations
